Things to keep track of in model:
	- All stationary eadible blobs, needs coordinates, size, value gained from eating it, (color).
	- All moving blobs, needs: speed, ability to move, coordinates, size, value gained from eating it, (color).
	- A way to compare if eadible is needed.

Should be able to make movable blobs inherit from stationary.

When feeding, the blob gains the eaten blob's area.
